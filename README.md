# âœ” Pure CSS

Checkdown is a pure CSS dropdown menu that utilizes the checkbox element.
 
Why checkbox? A checkbox is used in order to reliably switch between an open and closed state.

There are many other CSS tricks out there to create pure CSS dropdown menus.<br/>
Many of them opens on mouse hover. This is not always desirable.<br/>
Others open on click by using links and focus-within which might not be supported by older browsers.<br/>

The checkbox element is cross browser compatible and is incredible reliable!

There is no "hack" involved, just a cleaver use of HTML elements.<br/>
What is even better is that the dropdown menu is fully compatible with keyboard interactions. See images below:
